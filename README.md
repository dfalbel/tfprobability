This is the start of what hopefully will become the `tfprobability` package.

1) Done:

- installation (this is done in `tensorflow`)
- generic distribution methods (`sample`, `log_prob` ...)


2) WIP / partially implemented (all with tests):

- distribution layers 
- distributions
- bijectors


3) Top on wish list

- remaining distribution layers
- remaining distributions, bijectors
- variational layers (`tfp.layers`, different from the above distribution layers)
- `mcmc`
- `optimizer`
