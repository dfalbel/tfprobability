Description: R interface to TensorFlow Probability (TFP), a Python library built on TensorFlow
    that makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on modern hardware (TPU, GPU).
    TFP includes a wide selection of probability distributions and bijectors, probabilistic layers,
    variational inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and optimizers such as Nelder-Mead, BFGS, and SGLD.
